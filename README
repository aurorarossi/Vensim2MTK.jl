The file "model_translation" contain the function "simple_file_writer" that will print the string of the translated model. 
to use it, there is a need to change the filepath variable into the file path to the .xmile one want to parse. 
NB: it is important that for the models containing no tables, one must be manually added after the equations definition and before the parameters, so that the parser can separate the information correctly.
